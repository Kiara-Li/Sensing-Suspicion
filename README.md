### 💡 The Concept
This project aims to use **RoBERTa** to detect subtle *creepy signals*. By training on thousands of Reddit posts (e.g., *r/LetsNotMeet*, *r/TwoSentenceHorror*), the model learns linguistic patterns associated with unsafe situations, acting as a digital "gut feeling."

### 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Model:** RoBERTa-base (Fine-tuned on custom dataset)
* **Frontend:** Streamlit
* **Deployment:** Hugging Face & Streamlit Cloud
